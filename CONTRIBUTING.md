# Contributing to Region Helper

First off, welcome, and thanks for your interest in Region Helper! It's heartwarming to see people not just using and enjoying the extension, but also showing interest in contributing to it :)

Thanks also for reading these guidelines before contributing! I've kept them concise to help on that front. Following them will help keep the project maintainable, stable, and enjoyable for all of us (including users)!

## Issues

Assuming you're filing a bug report or feature request, as long as you fill out the template, you should be good to go. **Please do follow the issue templates!** I designed them to help me help you, while not overwhelming you with too much stuff to fill out.

If part or all of the relevant template is missing from your issue, I may ask you to fill it out before I can help you, or close out the issue to avoid repo clutter.

## Pull Requests

The following guidelines are especially important to read **before starting to work on a pull request**:

### Tie it to a single, pre-approved issue

With rare exceptions, every PR should begin with `Fixes: #X` or `Closes: #X`, where `#X` is an issue that's **open and labeled as [`accepting PRs`](https://github.com/alythobani/vscode-region-helper/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22accepting%20PRs%22)**. This helps protect your own time, keep PRs single-scoped, and maintain a collaborative and aligned development process between us.

### Align on approach first

Unless your code changes are trivial, it's best to **align with me on implementation approach** first, which we can do in the comments of the relevant issue. Region Helper's code can be nuanced, and I also want to keep it high-quality and maintainable. While my availability is limited, I'd still rather make time for alignment than have you spend time on a full PR I'll eventually reject. And there's hopefully no rush :) 🧘‍♂️

### End with your favorite emoji

Inspired (or stolen) from [typescript-eslint's guidelines](https://typescript-eslint.io/contributing/pull-requests) (but adapted to suggest my own favorite emoji):

> Please include your favorite emoji at the bottom of your pull request to hint to us that you did in fact read this file. 🌱 is a good starter if you're not sure which to use.

Thanks again for the interest in Region Helper, looking forward to seeing what you'd like to contribute!
